Intermittent messages:
Integrate pre-recorded mindfulness prompts:
Pause here. Take a deep breath and notice the sounds around you.
Look up! What patterns do you see in the trees or sky?
Check in: How is your self-talk right now? Are you being kind to yourself?
Take a moment to stretch and notice how your body feels.

Take a deep breath. What scents are in the air? Can you smell pine, earth, or fresh rain?
Check in with yourself. How does your body feel? What’s your energy level?
Look at the sunlight. How does it filter through the trees? What patterns does it create?
Watch how the wind moves. Notice the sway of trees, the ripples on a lake, or the way grass bends.
Stop and close your eyes for 10 seconds. What sensations do you feel? The warmth of the sun? A cool breeze?
Notice something small. A tiny insect, a dewdrop, or a hidden mushroom.
You’ve already come this far. Keep going—your journey is unfolding beautifully.
Observe your breath. Is it deep or shallow? Fast or slow? Take a moment to slow it down.
Look for something heart-shaped in nature. A leaf, a rock, or a cloud.
Notice your thoughts. Are they rushing? Are they calm? Let them come and go like clouds.
Name one thing you’re grateful for right now. Big or small.
What’s your pace? Are you moving quickly or slowly? Try matching your pace to your breath.
Smile, even if no one is around. Notice how it makes you feel.
Stand still for a moment. Feel the earth beneath your feet. You are grounded and supported.
Breathe in confidence, exhale doubt.
Look around you. Nature is always changing, just like life. Embrace the journey.
Touch the earth. Pick up a rock, feel the soil, or let water run through your fingers.
Find five different shades of green.
Take a deep breath and exhale slowly. Let go of any tension as you breathe out.
Every step forward is an accomplishment. Celebrate your progress.
If the trail gets tough, slow down and enjoy the moment. There's no rush.


If we choose to have a continuous message, here's a start:
Go ahead and start hiking.
Notice the position of your body as you walk.
Are you looking directly in front of you, or is your head slightly tilted in one direction?
What about your shoulders? Do you notice if they're directly above your hips? Or maybe leaning a bit ahead or behind?
Just notice. No need to change anything.
How far apart are your feet as you step? Are they close together? Maybe shoulder distance apart? How long are your strides?
See if you can begin to feel the connection between the firm and stable ground beneath you, and the souls of your feet as you walk.
Take a nice deep breath, letting your shoulders relax downward as you breath out.
Let your attention rest on your breathing as you return your breathing to its natural rhythm.
As you continue to walk, let your feet find their natural rythm.
Notice the speed you're walking at.
Are you walking slowly, or more quickly and energized?
Remember, there's no right or wrong, no good or bad. Just notice the pace of how you're walking with a sense of curiousity, not judgement.
(I'll add to this if we decide to go this route.)
